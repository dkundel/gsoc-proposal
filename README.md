### What is your academic background?
Last Semester Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Jacobs University Bremen, Germany

### What project do you want to build for CodeCombat?

### Why are you the right person to work on this project?

### Why are you interested in CodeCombat?
I did not have any programming experience whatsoever when I started my studies. JavaScript was not taught in class so I started learning it through educational pages such as Codecademy. Since then I was always interested in teaching other people (mainly without CS background) how to code and that JavaScript is easy to learn.

### What have you already contributed to CodeCombat?
- I changed the line highlighting in Tome
- Added editor configuration support to Tome
- Implemented an easy way to get the coordinates
- Brought Treema to Bower
- Currently I’m working on the support of CoffeeScript in CoCo

### How do you plan to achieve completion of your project?

### Are you open to working in a team with other students on the project?

### Please predict a schedule with dates and important milestones/deliverables (preferably in two week increments). Keep in mindHofstadter's law.

### Say you finish your project early or it proves impossible. What else would you be interested in working on?

### What are your past experiences with contributing to open source?
- I did contribute to big open source projects earlier, however most of the projects I’m working on (private, job or hackathon) are hosted on GitHub. 
- I recently started my own open source “movement” at our university to organize the different projects that are developed at our university and provide them a proper API to access the student directory at our university and build easy authentication.

### What other relevant projects have you worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them?

### What other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., will you have between May 19 and August 18?
- I will finish my Bachelor Thesis on May 11 and graduate from university on June  6. Therefore I won’t be busy with any jobs or school work. I’m planning a few short weekend trips however I will keep this in mind when scheduling my work and will work before and afterwards in a way that the missed days don’t interfere with the project.
